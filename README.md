# Submissions for the DPhi Bootcamp

## Jan 28 to Feb 10, 2022

DPhi is an online, open education community with a a vision to engineer the future of AI and democratize Data Science education. They regularly organise mini bootcamps through out the year. For the first bootcamp in 2022, I participated in the following courses: 

Introduction to Python

Introduction to Numpy

Introduction to Data Visualization

Introduction to Pandas


The bootcamp was very valuable to me as I got to refresh my knowledge of python. I learnt new things that I skipped when I initally started learning Python. Most importantly, I had the opportunity to work on my first project.
